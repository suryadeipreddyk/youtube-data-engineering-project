# YouTube Data Engineering Project

### Project Overview
----
This project is designed to build a scalable **data engineering pipeline** for processing and analyzing YouTube data using **AWS services**. The pipeline ingests raw data from YouTube, transforms it into a structured format, and stores it for analytics and reporting. The final processed data is used for business intelligence and visualization.

### Architecture Overview
---
The AWS-based data architecture enables efficient data ingestion, processing, and storage. Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested from source systems via the **S3 API** into an **S3 Landing Area**.
2. **Data Transformation**: **AWS Glue** and **AWS Lambda** handle data cleansing, enrichment, and transformation. **AWS Step Functions** orchestrate workflows.
3. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in **S3** and cataloged in the **AWS Glue Data Catalog** for querying via **AWS Athena**.
4. **Security & Monitoring**: Security is managed with **IAM**, and monitoring is done via **CloudWatch**.
5. **Analytics & Visualization**: The final data is used for analysis using **QuickSight, Power BI, and Qlik**.
